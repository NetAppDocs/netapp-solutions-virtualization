NetApp products integrates with OpenNebula to provide enterprise-grade storage capabilities through NAS and SAN protocols. ONTAP delivers advanced data management features including snapshots, cloning, replication, and ransomware protection for virtualized workloads running on OpenNebula clusters.

== Solution architecture

The solution architecture includes the following key components:

* *OpenNebula Frontend servers:* A set of OpenNebula frontend servers that provide cloud managment features to manage virtual machines (VMs) and Kubernetes Clusters.
* *OpenNebula Compute nodes:* A set of compute nodes that host the virtual machines and Kubernetes clusters managed by OpenNebula.
* *NetApp ONTAP storage:* A high-performance, scalable storage system that provides shared storage for the OpenNebula cluster.
* *Network infrastructure:* A robust network setup that ensures low-latency and high-throughput connectivity between OpenNebula nodes and ONTAP storage.
* *NetApp Console:* A centralized management interface for managing multiple NetApp storage systems and data services.


The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of OpenNebula integrated with NetApp ONTAP storage:
