Configure NFS vVols storage in a VI workload domain. After you deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere, you'll use the vSphere client interface to add the storage system, create a storage capability profile, and provision a vVols datastore.

== Step 1: Deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere
For VI workload domains, ONTAP tools is installed to the VCF Management Cluster but registered with the vCenter associated with the VI workload domain. 

ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere is deployed as a VM appliance and provides an integrated vCenter UI for managing ONTAP storage.

== Step 2: Add a storage system
Perform the following steps to add a storage system using ONTAP tools.


NOTE: vVol requires ONTAP cluster credentials rather than SVM credentials. For more information, refer to the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere documentation: https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere/configure/task_add_storage_systems.html[Add storage systems^].

== Step 3: Create an NFS datastore in ONTAP tools
Complete the following steps to deploy an ONTAP datastore running on NFS. Use ONTAP tools.

.Steps
. In ONTAP tools select *Overview* and from the *Getting Started* tab click on *Provision* to start the wizard.

+
{nbsp}
. On the *General* page of the New Datastore wizard, select the vSphere datacenter or cluster destination. 
. Select *NFS* as the datastore type, enter a name for the datastore, and select the protocol.  

. Choose whether to use FlexGroup volumes and whether to use a storage capability file for provisioning. 

. Click *Next* to continue.
+
NOTE: Selecting to *Distribute datastore data across the cluster* will create the underlying volume as a FlexGroup volume, which precludes the use of Storage Capability Profiles. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/flexgroup/supported-unsupported-config-concept.html[Supported and unsupported configurations for FlexGroup volumes^] for more information on using FlexGroup Volumes.

. On the *Storage system* page, select the select a storage capability profile, the storage system, and the SVM. Click *Next* to continue.
+

. On the *Storage attributes* page, select the aggregate to use and then click *Next* to continue.

== Step 4: Create a vVols datastore in ONTAP tools
To create a vVols datastore in ONTAP tools, complete the following steps.

.Steps
. In ONTAP tools, select *Overview* and from the *Getting Started* tab, click *Provision* to start the wizard.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-041.png[Provision datastore]

. On the *General* page of the New Datastore wizard, select the vSphere datacenter or cluster destination. 

. Select *vVols* as the datastore type, enter a name for the datastore, and select *NFS* as the protocol. 

. Click *Next* to continue.
+

. On the *Storage system* page, select a storage capability profile, the storage system, and the SVM. 

. Click *Next* to continue.
+

. On the *Storage attributes* page, select *Create a new volumes* and enter the storage attributes of the volume to be created. 
+

+
. Click *Add* to create the volume and then *Next* to continue.
+

+
. Review the *Summary* page and click *Finish* to start the vVol datastore creation process.
