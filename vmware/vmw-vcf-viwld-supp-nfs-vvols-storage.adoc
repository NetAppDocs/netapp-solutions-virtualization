Configure NFS vVols storage in a VI workload domain. After you deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere, you'll use the vSphere client interface to add the storage system, create a storage capability profile, and provision a vVols datastore.

== Step 1: Deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere
For VI workload domains, ONTAP tools for VMware is installed to the VCF Management Cluster but registered with the vCenter associated with the VI workload domain. 

.Steps
. Obtain the ONTAP tools OVA image from the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/otv/downloads-tab[NetApp Support site] and download it to a local folder.

. Log in to the vCenter appliance for the VCF management domain.

. From the vCenter appliance interface, right-click the management cluster and select *Deploy OVF Template…*.
+

+
{nbsp}
. In the *Deploy OVF Template* wizard, click the *Local file* radio button and select the ONTAP tools OVA file you downloaded in the previous step.
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-022.png[Select OVA file]
+
{nbsp}
. For steps 2 through 5 of the wizard, select a name and folder for the VM, select the compute resource, review the details, and accept the license agreement.

. For the storage location of the configuration and disk files, select the vSAN datastore of the VCF management domain cluster.
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-023.png[Select OVA file]
+
{nbsp}
. On the Select network page, select the network used for management traffic.
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-024.png[Select network]
+
{nbsp}
. On the Customize template page, fill out all required information:
* Password to be used for administrative access to OTV.
* NTP server IP address.
* OTV maintenance account password.
* OTV Derby DB password.
* Do not check the box to *Enable VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF)*. VCF mode is not required for deploying supplemental storage.
* FQDN or IP address of the vCenter appliance for the *VI Workload Domain*
* Credentials for the vCenter appliance of the *VI Workload Domain*
* Provide the required network properties fields.
+
Click *Next* to continue.
+

+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-035.png[Customize OTV template 2]
+
{nbsp}
. Review all information on the Ready to complete page, and the click Finish to begin deploying the OTV appliance.

== Step 2: Add a storage system
Perform the following steps on the VCF management domain cluster using the vSphere client.

.Steps
. From the main menu in the vSphere client, select *NetApp ONTAP tools*.
+
image:vmware-asa-006.png[NetApp ONTAP tools]
+
{nbsp}
. From the *INSTANCE* drop-down menu in the ONTAP Tool interface, select the OTV instance associated with the workload domain to be managed.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-036.png[Choose OTV instance]
+
{nbsp}
. In ONTAP tools, select *Storage Systems* from the left hand menu and then press *Add*.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-037.png[Add storage system]
+
{nbsp}
. Fill out the IP Address, credentials of the storage system, and the port number. Click *Add* to start the discovery process.
//vVol requires ONTAP Cluster credential rather than SVM credential. Better to link to product documentation
+

== Step 3: Create an NFS datastore in ONTAP tools
Complete the following steps to deploy an ONTAP datastore running on NFS. Use ONTAP tools.

.Steps
. In ONTAP tools select *Overview* and from the *Getting Started* tab click on *Provision* to start the wizard.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-041.png[Provision datastore]
+
{nbsp}
. On the *General* page of the New Datastore wizard, select the vSphere datacenter or cluster destination. 
. Select *NFS* as the datastore type, enter a name for the datastore, and select the protocol.  

. Choose whether to use FlexGroup volumes and whether to use a storage capability file for provisioning. 

. Click *Next* to continue.
+
NOTE: Selecting to *Distribute datastore data across the cluster* will create the underlying volume as a FlexGroup volume, which precludes the use of Storage Capability Profiles. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/flexgroup/supported-unsupported-config-concept.html[Supported and unsupported configurations for FlexGroup volumes] for more information on using FlexGroup Volumes.
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-042.png[General page]
+
{nbsp}
. On the *Storage system* page, select the select a storage capability profile, the storage system, and the SVM. Click *Next* to continue.
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-043.png[Storage system]
+
{nbsp}
. On the *Storage attributes* page, select the aggregate to use and then click *Next* to continue.
+

+
{nbsp}

. Review the *Summary* and click Finish to begin creating the NFS datastore.
+

== Step 4: Create a vVols datastore in ONTAP tools
To create a vVols datastore in ONTAP tools, complete the following steps.

.Steps
. In ONTAP tools, select *Overview* and from the *Getting Started* tab click on *Provision* to start the wizard.
+
image:vmware-vcf-asa-041.png[Provision datastore]

. On the *General* page of the New Datastore wizard, select the vSphere datacenter or cluster destination. Select *vVols* as the datastore type, fill out a name for the datastore, and select *NFS* as the protocol. Click *Next* to continue.
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-046.png[General page]

. On the *Storage system* page, select the select a storage capability profile, the storage system, and the SVM. Click *Next* to continue.
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-043.png[Storage system]

. On the *Storage attributes* page, select to create a new volume for the datastore and fill out the storage attributes of the volume to be created. Click *Add* to create the volume and then *Next* to continue.
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-047.png[Storage attributes]
+
image:vmware-vcf-aff-048.png[Storage attributes - Next]

. Finally, review the *Summary* and click *Finish* to start the vVol datastore creation process.
