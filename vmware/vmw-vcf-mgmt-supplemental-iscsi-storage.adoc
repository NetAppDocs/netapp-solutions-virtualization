Set up supplemental iSCSI storage to expand VMware Cloud Foundation management domains. This procedure includes deploying ONTAP tools, adding a storage system to the VCF management domain, and migrating management VMs to the new datastore.

Perform the following steps on the VCF management domain cluster using the vSphere client.

== Step 1: Deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere

ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere (OTV) is deployed as a VM appliance and provides an integrated vCenter UI for managing ONTAP storage.

== Step 2: Add a storage system
Perform the following steps to add a storage system using ONTAP tools.

.Steps
include::../_include/add-storage-ontap-tools.adoc[]

== Optional: Migrate management VMs to the iSCSI datastore

In cases where you prefer to use ONTAP storage to protect the VCF management VMs, use vMotion to migrate the VMs to the newly created iSCSI datastore.

.Steps
. From the vSphere Client navigate to the management domain cluster and click the *VMs* tab.

. Select the VMs to be migrated to the iSCSI datastore, right click and select *Migrate..*.
