Create a Storage Virtual Machine (SVM) with multiple Logical Interfaces (LIFs) to provide iSCSI connectivity for VMware Cloud Foundation management domains. You'll configure the SVM with iSCSI protocol support and set up multiple LIFs across separate Ethernet networks to enable multipathing and failover for optimal performance and availability.

To add new LIFs to an existing SVM, refer to the ONTAP documentation: link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/create_a_lif.html[Create ONTAP LIFs^].
