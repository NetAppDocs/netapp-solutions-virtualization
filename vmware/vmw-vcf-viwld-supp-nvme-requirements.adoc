Review the recommended network design and infrastructure requirements to deploy NVMe vVols in a VMware Cloud Foundation VI workload domain. You need a fully configured ONTAP AFF or ASA storage system, a deployed VCF management domain, and an existing VI workload domain.

== Infrastructure requirements
* An ONTAP AFF or ASA storage system with physical data ports on ethernet switches dedicated to storage traffic.
* VCF management domain deployment is complete and the vSphere client is accessible.
* A VI workload domain has been previously deployed.

== Recommended NVMe/TCP network design
NetApp recommends fully redundant network designs for NVMe/TCP. The following diagram illustrates an example of a redundant configuration, providing fault tolerance for storage systems, switches, networks adapters and host systems.

For multipathing and failover across multiple paths, configure a minimum of two LIFs per storage node in separate ethernet networks for all SVMs in NVMe/TCP configurations.
