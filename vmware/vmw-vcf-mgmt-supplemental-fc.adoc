[.lead]
Configure a VMFS datastore over Fibre Channel (FC) as supplemental storage for the VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) management domain. You'll deploy ONTAP tools on the management domain, add a storage backend, and provision the datastore.

.Before you begin

Make sure the following components and configurations are in place.

* An ONTAP storage system with FC ports connected to FC switches.
* SVM created with FC LIFs.
* vSphere with FC HBAs connected to FC switches.
* Single initiator-target zoning is configured on FC switches.
+
[NOTE]
====
* Use SVM FC logical interface in zone configuration rather than physical FC ports on ONTAP systems.

* Use multipath for FC LUNs.
====

.Steps
. Deploy ONTAP tools on the management domain by following the instructions in the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere documentation: link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere-10/deploy/ontap-tools-deployment.html[Deploy ONTAP tools on management domain].
+
The ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere appliance is deployed as a small-sized single node with core services to support NFS and VMFS datastores.

. Add a storage backend using the vSphere client interface by following the instructions in the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere documentation: link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere-10/configure/add-storage-backend.html[Define Storage backend using vSphere client interface].
+
Adding a storage backend enables you to onboard an ONTAP cluster. 

. Provision VMFS on FC by following the instructions in the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere documentation: link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere-10/configure/create-datastore.html[Provision VMFS on FC].
