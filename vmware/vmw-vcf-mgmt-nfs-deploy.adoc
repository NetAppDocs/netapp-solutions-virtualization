Deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10 and provision an NFS datastore to enable seamless integration with VMware Cloud Foundation. This procedure guides you through deploying ONTAP tools, configuring storage backends, and creating an NFS datastore to support the conversion of a vSphere 8 cluster to a VCF management domain.

== Step 1: Deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere

In this step ONTAP tools 10 is deployed in a non-HA configuration. For additional deployment details on HA and non-HA configurations refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere-10/deploy/ontap-tools-deployment.html[Deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere].

.Steps
. Download the ONTAP tools 10 OVA template from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/[NetApp support site].
. In the vSphere client, right click the cluster and click *Deploy OVF Template*.

. In the *Deploy OVF Template* complete the steps to:
* Select an OVF template.
* Select a name and folder.
* Select a compute resource.
* Review Details.
* Agree to the license agreement.

. On the *Configuration* page of the template, select the deployment type including whether to deploy ONTAP tools in an HA configuration. Click *Next* to continue.
+

. On the *Select storage* page, choose the datastore on which to install the VM, and click  *Next*.
. Select the network that the ONTAP tools VM will communicate on. Click *Next* to continue.
. On the **Customize template* window, complete all required information.
* Application username and password
* Choose whether to enable ASUP (auto support) including a proxy URL.
* Administrator username and password.
* NTP servers.
* Maintenance username and password (maint account used at the console).
* Provide the required IP addresses for the deployment configuration.
* Provide all networking information for the node configuration.

. Click *Next* to continue and then click *Finish* to begin the deployment.

== Step 2: Configure ONTAP tools
After the ONTAP tools VM is installed and powered up, you need to add the vCenter servers and the ONTAP storage systems you want to manage. 

.Steps
. Add vCenter instances by following the instructions in the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere documentation: https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere-10/configure/add-vcenter.html[Add vCenter instances].

. To add an ONTAP storage system, log into the vSphere client and navigate to the main menu on the left. Click *NetApp ONTAP tools* to launch the user interface.
+

. Navigate to *Storage Backends* in the left hand menu and click *Add* to access the *Add Storage Backend* window.
. Enter the IP address and credentials for the ONTAP storage system to be managed. Click *Add* to finish.

NOTE: Here, the storage backend is added in the vSphere client UI using the cluster IP address. This allows full management over all SVMs in the storage system. Alternately, the storage backend can be added and associated with a vCenter instance using ONTAP tools Manager at `https://loadBalanceIP:8443/virtualization/ui/`. With this method only SVM credentials can be added at the vSphere client UI, providing more granular control over storage access.

== Step 3: Provision the NFS datastore
ONTAP tools integrates functionality throughout the vSphere client UI. In this step an NFS datastore is provisioned from the storage inventory page.

. In the vSphere client, navigate to the storage inventory.
. Navigate to *ACTIONS > NetApp ONTAP tools > Create datastore*.
+

. In the *Create Datastore* wizard, select the type of datastore to create. Options are NFS or VMFS.
. On the *Name and Protocol* page, fill in a name for the datastore, the size, and the NFS protocol to be used.
+

. On the *Storage* page, select the ONTAP storage platform and the storage virtual machine (SVM). You can also select any available custom export policies here. Click *Next* to continue.
+

. On the *Storage Attributes* page, select the storage aggregate to be used. Click on *Next* to continue.
. On the *Summary* page, review the information and click *Finish* to begin the provisioning process. 
+
ONTAP tools will create a volume on the ONTAP storage system and mount it as an NFS datastore to all ESXi hosts in the cluster.
