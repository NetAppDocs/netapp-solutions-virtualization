Deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10 and provision an NFS datastore to enable seamless integration with VMware Cloud Foundation. You'll deploy ONTAP tools, configure storage backends, and create an NFS datastore to support the conversion of a vSphere 8 cluster to a VCF management domain.

== Step 1: Deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere

In this step, ONTAP tools are deployed in a non-HA configuration. For additional deployment details on HA and non-HA configurations refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere-10/deploy/ontap-tools-deployment.html[Deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere].

.Steps
. Download the ONTAP tools OVA template from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/[NetApp support site].
. In the vSphere client, right-click the cluster and click *Deploy OVF Template*.
+

. In the *Deploy OVF Template* complete the steps to:
* Select an OVF template.
* Select a name and folder.
* Select a compute resource.
* Review Details.
* Agree to the license agreement.

. On the *Configuration* page of the template, select the deployment type, including whether to deploy ONTAP tools in an HA configuration. Click *Next* to continue.
+

. On the *Select storage* page, choose the datastore on which to install the VM, and click  *Next*.
. Select the network that the ONTAP tools VM will communicate on. Click *Next* to continue.
. On the **Customize template* window, complete all required information.
* Application username and password
* Choose whether to enable ASUP (AutoSupport). Include a proxy URL.
* Administrator username and password.
* NTP servers.
* Maintenance username and password ("maint" account used at the console).
* Provide the required IP addresses for the deployment configuration.
* Provide all networking information for the node configuration.
+

. Click *Next* to continue, and then click *Finish* to begin the deployment.

== Step 2: Configure ONTAP tools
After the ONTAP tools VM is installed and powered up, add the vCenter servers and the ONTAP storage systems you want to manage. 

.Steps
. Add vCenter instances by following the instructions in the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere documentation: https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere-10/configure/add-vcenter.html[Add vCenter instances].

. To add an ONTAP storage system, log into the vSphere client and navigate to the main menu on the left. Click *NetApp ONTAP tools* to launch the user interface.
+

. Navigate to *Storage Backends* in the left hand menu and click *Add* to access the *Add Storage Backend* window.
. Enter the IP address and credentials for the ONTAP storage system to be managed. Click *Add* to finish.

TIP: To allow full management over all SVMs in the storage system, add the storage backend in the vSphere client UI using the cluster IP address. Alternatively, use ONTAP tools Manager at `https://loadBalanceIP:8443/virtualization/ui/` to add and associate the storage backend with a vCenter instance. This alternate method allows you to add only SVM credentials at the vSphere client UI, which provides more granular control over storage access.

== Step 3: Provision the NFS datastore
ONTAP tools integrates functionality throughout the vSphere client UI. In this step, an NFS datastore is provisioned from the storage inventory page.

. In the vSphere client, navigate to the storage inventory.
. Navigate to *ACTIONS > NetApp ONTAP tools > Create datastore*.
+

. In the *Create Datastore* wizard, select the type of datastore to create. Options are NFS or VMFS.
. On the *Name and Protocol* page, enter a name for the datastore, the size, and the NFS protocol to be used.
+

. On the *Storage* page, select the ONTAP storage platform and the storage virtual machine (SVM). You can also select any available custom export policies here. Click *Next* to continue.
+

. On the *Storage Attributes* page, select the storage aggregate to be used. Click on *Next* to continue.
. On the *Summary* page, review the information and click *Finish* to begin the provisioning process.

ONTAP tools creates a volume on the ONTAP storage system and mounts it as an NFS datastore to all ESXi hosts in the cluster.
