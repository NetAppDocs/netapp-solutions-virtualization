Create a Storage Virtual Machine (SVM) and multiple logical interfaces (LIFs) on an ONTAP system to support NFS traffic for vVols datastores in a VMware Cloud Foundation VI workload domain.

To add new LIFs to an existing SVM, refer to the ONTAP documentation: link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/create_a_lif.html[Create ONTAP LIFs^].

.Steps
. In ONTAP System Manager, navigate to *Storage VMs* in the left-hand menu and click on *+ Add* to start.

+
{nbsp}
. In the *Add Storage VM* wizard, provide a *Name* for the SVM, select the *IP Space* and then, under *Access Protocol*, click the *SMB/CIFS, NFS, S3* tab and check the box to *Enable NFS*.

TIP: You don't need to check the *Allow NFS client access* checkbox. ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere will be used to automate the datastore deployment process, which includes providing client access for the ESXi hosts.
//{nbsp}
. In the *Network Interface* section, fill in the *IP address*, *Subnet Mask*, and *Broadcast Domain and Port* for the first LIF. For subsequent LIFs, you can either use individual settings or enable the checkbox to use common settings across all remaining LIFs.

{nbsp}
. Choose whether to enable the Storage VM Administration account (for multi-tenancy environments) and click *Save* to create the SVM.
