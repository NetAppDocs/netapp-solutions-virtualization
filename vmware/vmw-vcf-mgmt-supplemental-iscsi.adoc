summary: "Get started with adding an iSCSI datastore as supplemental storage for a VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) management domain. You'll set up a Storage Virtual Machine (SVM) with logical interfaces (LIFs) for iSCSI, configure iSCSI networking on ESXi hosts, deploy ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere, and create a VMFS datastore."
