Converting a vSphere environment with existing datastores (either Fibre Channel or NFS) running on ONTAP involves integrating the current infrastructure into a modern private cloud architecture.

== Solution overview
In this solution we will demonstrate how existing datastores (FC or NFS) in vSphere 8 become principal storage when the cluster is converted to a VCF management domain.

This process benefits from the robustness and flexibility of ONTAP storage to ensure seamless data access and management. After a VCF management domain is established through the conversion process, administrators can efficiently import additional vSphere environments, including those using both FC and NFS datastores, into the VCF ecosystem.

This integration not only enhances resource utilization but also simplifies the management of private cloud infrastructure, ensuring a smooth transition with minimal disruption to existing workloads.

== Architecture overview
The architecture of ONTAP tools 10 is designed to integrate seamlessly with VMware environments, leveraging a modular and scalable framework that includes the ONTAP tools services, vSphere plug-in, and REST APIs to enable efficient storage management, automation, and data protection.

ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10 can be installed in either HA or non-HA configurations.
