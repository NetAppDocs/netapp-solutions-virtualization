Configure NVMe/TCP vVols storage in a VMware Cloud Foundation VI workload domain. You'll deploy ONTAP tools, register a storage system, create a storage capability profile, and provision a vVols datastore in the vSphere client.

.Steps

. In the vSphere client, navigate to one of the ESXi hosts in the workload domain cluster. From the *Actions* menu select *Storage > New Datastore...*.
