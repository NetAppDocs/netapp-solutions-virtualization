[.lead]
In this use case we outline the procedure to configure a VMFS datastore using Fiber Channel (FC) as supplemental storage for a VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) Virtual Infrastructure (VI) workload domain. This procedure summarizes deploying ONTAP Tools for VMware vSphere, registering the VI workload vCenter server, defining the storage backend, and provisioning the FC datastore.

.Before you begin
Make sure the following components and configurations are in place.

* An ONTAP AFF or ASA storage system with FC ports connected to FC switches.
* SVM created with FC LIFs.
* vSphere with FC HBAs connected to FC switches.
* Single initiator-target zoning is configured on FC switches.

[NOTE]
====
* Use SVM FC logical interface in zone configuration rather than physical FC ports on ONTAP systems.
* Use multipath for FC LUNs.
====

.Steps
. Register the VI workload vCenter by following the instructions in the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere documentation: 
link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere-10/configure/add-vcenter.html[Register VI workload vCenter].
+
Registering the VI workload vCenter enables the vCenter plugin.

. Add a storage backend using the vSphere client interface by following the instructions in the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere documentation: link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere-10/configure/add-storage-backend.html[Define Storage backend using vSphere client interface].
+
Adding a storage backend enables you to onboard an ONTAP cluster.

. Provision VMFS on Fibre Channel (FC)by following the instructions in the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere documentation: link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-tools-vmware-vsphere-10/configure/create-datastore.html[Provision VMFS on FC].
