Review the recommended network design and infrastructure requirements to deploy NFS vVols in a VMware Cloud Foundation VI workload domain. You need a fully configured ONTAP AFF or ASA storage system, a completed VCF management domain, and an existing VI workload domain. 

== Infrastructure requirements
Make sure the following components and configurations are in place.

* An ONTAP AFF or FAS storage system with physical data ports on ethernet switches dedicated to storage traffic.
* VCF management domain deployment is complete and the vSphere client is accessible.
* A VI workload domain has been previously deployed.

== Recommended NFS network design
Configure redundant network designs for NFS to provide fault tolerance for storage systems, switches, networks adapters and host systems. It's common to deploy NFS with a single subnet or multiple subnets depending on the architectural requirements.

== Additional information
* For detailed information specific to VMware vSphere, refer to https://www.vmware.com/docs/vmw-best-practices-running-nfs-vmware-vsphere[Best Practices For Running NFS with VMware vSphere].

* For network guidance on using ONTAP with VMware vSphere refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-apps-dbs/vmware/vmware-vsphere-network.html#nfs[Network configuration - NFS] section of the NetApp enterprise applications documentation.

This documentation demonstrates the process of creating a new SVM and specifying the IP address information to create multiple LIFs for NFS traffic. To add new LIFs to an existing SVM refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/networking/create_a_lif.html[Create a LIF (network interface)].

* For complete information on using NFS with vSphere clusters, refer to the link:vmw-vvf-overview.html[NFS v3 Reference Guide for vSphere 8].
