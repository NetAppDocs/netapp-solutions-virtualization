Proxmox Backup Server (PBS) integrates with NetApp ONTAP storage to deliver enterprise backup capabilities for Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE) workloads. This architecture provides incremental backups, deduplication, compression, encryption, and disaster recovery using ONTAP SnapMirror replication.

== Solution architecture

The solution includes the following components:

* *Proxmox VE cluster* - Provides virtualization capabilities and manages virtual machines (VMs) and containers across multiple nodes.
* *Proxmox Backup Server* - Delivers dedicated backup and restore capabilities for Proxmox VE workloads with integration to ONTAP storage.
* *NetApp ONTAP storage* - Provides high-performance, scalable storage for the Proxmox VE cluster and PBS backup datastores.
* *Network infrastructure* - Ensures low-latency, high-throughput connectivity between Proxmox VE nodes, PBS, and ONTAP storage.
* *NetApp Console* - Offers centralized management for multiple NetApp storage systems and data services.

The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of the Proxmox Backup Server setup with ONTAP storage:
