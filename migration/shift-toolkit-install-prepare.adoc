Prepare to install the NetApp Shift Toolkit by ensuring your environment meets the prerequisites and selecting the appropriate installation package for your deployment scenario.

== Before you begin

Verify that your environment meets the following requirements:

* Windows Server 2019, 2022, or 2025
* Dedicated virtual machine for the Shift Toolkit installation
* Network connectivity between source and target environments
* Virtual machine running on VMware vSphere or Microsoft Hyper-V

NOTE: Install the Shift Toolkit on a dedicated VM to enable management of multiple source and target hypervisors from a single server.

== Select an installation package

The Shift Toolkit is available in two installation packages from link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/netapp-shift-toolkit[NetApp Toolchest]:

*Online installer (~130 MB)*

* Downloads and installs prerequisites from the internet during installation
* Requires internet connectivity during installation
* Smaller package size for faster download

*Offline installer (~1.2 GB)*

* Includes all prerequisites bundled within the package
* Supports installation on VMs without internet access
* No proxy configuration required
* Provides more control over the installation process
