Prior to installing the Shift Toolkit, ensure that the environment is set up for and supports installation.

== Preparing for Installation

To get started with the toolkit, use a windows operating system on a designated virtual machine and make sure you meet the prerequisites, then install the package.

Shift toolkit can be run on Windows 2019, 2022 and 2025 version. Download the Shift toolkit package from link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/netapp-shift-toolkit[NetApp Toolchest] and then unzip the package and run the exe to install and start the service. Shift toolkit provides 2 packages – Online (~130MB in size) and Offline (~1.2GB in size). As the name indicates, online installer package downloads and installs the necessary pre-requisites from the internet.

While online installation offers convenience, offline installation provides more control over the installation process. With offline installation package, all the necessary pre-requisites are bundled within the package to install Shift toolkit. One major advantage of offline installation is that it allows to install Shift toolkit on virtual machines without an internet connection.

TIP: Use the appropriate package for deployment. With offline mode, there is no need to modify the proxy settings as all the pre-requisites and files required are bundled.

Shift toolkit can be installed on a virtual machine running VMware or Microsoft Hyper-V server as long as there is connectivity between source and target environments, and it is a best practice to install Shift toolkit on its own VM. This approach allows you to target different Microsoft Hyper-V servers or VMware ESXi servers with a single Shift toolkit server.

NOTE: Install Shift toolkit on a dedicated VM.
