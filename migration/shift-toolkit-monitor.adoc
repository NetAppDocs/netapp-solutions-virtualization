Use the Shift Toolkit Job Monitoring dashboard to track migration, conversion, and blueprint operations in real time, allowing you to quickly identify job status and resolve issues.

== Job monitoring dashboard

The Job Monitoring dashboard provides a centralized view of all active and completed operations within the Shift Toolkit. Use this dashboard to monitor the progress of your migration, conversion, and blueprint jobs.

The dashboard displays key information for each job:

* Job type (migration, conversion, or blueprint)
* Current status (running, successful, failed, or partially failed)
* Progress indicators and completion percentage
* Number of VMs processed
* Start and end times

== Understanding job status

The intuitive interface enables you to quickly evaluate the status of all operations and identify jobs that require attention.

Job status indicators help you understand the outcome of each operation:

* *Successful*: All VMs in the job completed without errors
* *Failed*: The job encountered errors and could not complete
* *Partially failed*: Some VMs completed successfully while others encountered errors
* *Running*: The job is currently in progress

Use the status information to prioritize troubleshooting efforts and ensure smooth migration workflows.
