NOTE: The installation can take 10 -15 mins.

== Performing an upgrade

Upgrades are now fully automated and can be completed with a single click. An additional service makes the upgrades seamless. Shit toolkit updater service, which listens on port 3002 performs the following steps:

. Download the upgrade package.
. Stop the Shift toolkit service
. Extract the files and overwrite the required files.
. Run update and uses the same IP address (retaining the metadata as is).
. Once done, the UI is redirected to Shift toolkit UI listening on port 3001

NOTE: For deployments without internet connectivity, manually download the upgrade package starting with “update” from the NetApp Toolchest and place it in a designated folder (C:\NetApp_Shift). This folder path should be created and specified during the update process. All other steps remain the same as in the online upgrade procedure.
